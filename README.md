# BitCampProject
We are making non fungible tokens 
To make some NFTs, download the project first. Then install node JS if you haven't already. 
You can then run 'npx hardhat node' to start the local chain. Then open another terminal and use 'npx hardhat compile' to compile the smart contract. Then use 'npm run dev' to start a live server with your NFTs.
